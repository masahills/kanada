Kanada
======

A Java library to transliterate Kanji-Kana-mixed Japanese text into Hiragana, Katakana, or Romaji representations.
The Kanada is also useful for text segmentation processing (word-splitting or 'wakachi-gaki') for further morphological analysis.

This is something I wrote (ported from KAKASI) more than a decade ago and hasn't been maintained since then.
I'm planning to refine the library so that it become useful for Android app developers.
